title: "100 Days of UI"
---

As part of a plan to improve on my UI skills, I have decided to go through the [100 Days of UI](http://www.dailyui.co/){:target="_blank"} challenge.

#### Day 05 | App Icon | 2hrs

Design of an icon for an app aimed at skiers and snowboarders that need to find out more about snow conditions when training.

I wanted to illustrate this from scratch, so I went for a simple design using triangles and ovals that I then deformed to create the snow. The color scheme is influenced by the background photo.

#### Day 04 | Calculator | 1 hr

Super simple re-design of a calculator. Tried to find some inspo but couldn't find anything exciting AND functional at the same time, so ended up going with a ready-tested design of a calculator app for iPhone.

#### Day 03 | Landing page | 1hr 30min
Very simple landing page for a social network for female travelers looking for companionship during their time abroad. I loved the image, and also spent some time figuring out how to do animations on Sketch using the Timeline plugin :)

#### Day 02 | Credit card checkout | 3-4 hrs
Checkout page for an independent e-commerce business selling clothes. The design is subtle and understated.

#### Day 01 | Sign up screen | 2-3 hrs
Sign in screen for an app targeted at bicycle riders wanting to find their way around a specific city. Like Citymapper, but for bikes. The idea comes from a particular problem I often face when trying to find my way around London.

This sign in screen assumes the user already has an account.
