I once fell in love with a startup.

I was not that young, nor that innocent, but I was coming from a different world where everything moved slowly and people were still averse to ebooks. That was the world of publishing, which I found to be beautiful in my mind and hard to get into *and* dull once you were in it in reality. Don’t get me wrong, I still love *the idea* of working in publishing or being the founder of my own publishing company someday, but I also know that the career path to becoming a Publisher is long and arduous, and involves a lot of time doing admin work that would not fulfil my need for a fast-paced environment.

And so, in 2015, I landed a Marketing role within a startup which would change not only my career, but my standards of what work should be – and *feel* - like.

To be honest, I don't know how that happened. I mean, I *do* know how it happened, but somehow it still felt like a surprise. I was interning within the Marketing team of an academic publisher when I met my current partner, an energetic software developer who was already talking about startups on our first date. My internship would be ending soon, and he wanted to help me find a full-time job. He was looking for a new role himself, and so coincidentally came across an opportunity that he thought *might* work for me; it was a Marketing Associate role at an emerging startup. I applied and they gave me a technical task to do where I had to write some *tweets* for their social media account and a blog post. And I did. I wrote one of my favourite posts to this day, a story that was good enough to get me an interview and – later – a new job.

I started at that startup when the company had about 30 employees, and I was the third member of the recently created Marketing Team. In a few months we'd be moving offices, first one floor, then we'd take over the floor beneath. By the time I left two years later, that startup had offices in London, Lisbon and San Francisco, and a team of +140 employees. In hindsight, such a rate of growth was insane, but it didn't feel that way. Somehow it felt right.

> When I say I fell in love, I really mean it. I spoke about that startup as if they were the perfect company. From the office supplies and equipment to the talented individuals that surrounded me, and from the team members I watched evolve into new and exciting career paths to the innovation in processes, tools and management, that startup kept dazzling me.

I was particularly lucky in that my team was led by a fantastic manager with a strong set of values that helped create a great culture within the Marketing Team. To this day, I still talk about my experience at that startup as if it was my first love. And in a sense, it was. Which is why it crushed me when, a year in, I found out that the startup was not perfect. When I realised that not every single employee was as happy as I was.

I remember the feeling really well. I remember the disappointment after I had a chat with someone from a different team, someone who told me so and so had done this and said that. I don't even remember who it was or what they did, but I remember the heartbreak. It was real. I had idealised – idolised – a company and the people that worked in it, and as a result my expectations were high. The thing about high expectations is that they are hardly ever fulfilled, and when they are it should only come as a surprise, but I didn't know that at the time. All I knew was that the startup wasn't perfect to my eyes anymore, and boy did that hurt. For a few weeks I felt absolutely disenchanted. I looked elsewhere for other jobs. Maybe I didn't even want to go to work anymore. I'd observe everyone in the office, consider their internal dynamics under a different light. I couldn't believe those people were human, that they were just as flawed as I was myself. They couldn't be! They should have been perfect! But they weren't. No one is. And if no one is perfect, no company can ever be perfect either.

> That experience taught me a hard lesson, which is that expectations are necessary but the higher they are the more problematic they become. It forced me to consider my deal breakers, like you would in any type of relationship, and to accept that – really – there is no perfect anything. That some things can be good. Maybe even very good. Maybe even great! But never perfect.

I was coming from companies where I didn't quite fit in terms of company culture and values, and so – in comparison – that startup was a new shiny perfect place to work. And it was. And it wasn't.

Because the truth is I went on to change careers and transition as a designer, and I went on to work in new and very different teams for new and very different products, but I still think about that startup as an example of many great processes, and innovative ideas, and brilliant talent, and fantastic company culture.

But it is also true that I might be biased, and that others don't think of that startup the way I do. It is probable that some people didn't feel this way, which is why they left soon after joining us. And so, everyone's experience is different. Everyone comes from a different place and will end up in a different place, and all team members have in common is the fact that they coincided during a specific time in a specific team, sharing a bunch of experiences that hopefully transformed them in a positive way.

It's been two years since I left, and I don't know where that startup is at. I don't know what or how they are doing. I *do* know, however, that many of the original employees have left, but many others have also stayed. And I also know that I trust their founders and their drive to build a great place to work and develop both as a professional and as a human being.

To the first – and last – company I fell in love with I owe a few hard and painful lessons, and the knowledge and experience I gained from them. And – in hindsight – I don't think it could have been any other way.
