As a designer, I believe it is of paramount importance that I understand front-end programming. I don't think anyone should expect designers to be able to code, but I do think we should be expected to _understand_ HTML, CSS and JavaScript, their capabilities and their constraints.

With that in mind, a month ago I signed up to [Design + Code](https://designcode.io), an online resource for designers who want to learn some code and coders who want to know more about design.

### React for Designers

I started with a course to learn some React, a JavaScript framework that should help with building components (and re-using them) and creating some fancy animations.

I started building an example website based on Design + Code's own website, but eventually the design evolved into an alternative portfolio that I will probably never use.
