title: "Short Fiction: The Life of a Grape"
---

Of the 180 writing prompts you can find [here](http://www.dailyteachingtools.com/journal-writing-prompts.html#1), I picked the one below:

<blockquote>
<p>Be a grape that becomes a raisin: describe how it feels to shrink, to shrivel, to become dry and wrinkled.</p>
</blockquote>

-----------

To be honest, I have enjoyed my life so far. It's been a matter of constant change, moving from one phase into the next, never boring, always surprising and somewhat challenging. I was born into life as a plump, green grape. I was beautiful, soft and oval, a pretty shade of pale green. You could see what was inside me if you let the light come through my juicy body; I was honest, transparent: with me, you knew what you could get in an instant.

I was of the seeded variety. I know you can now find many who *look* like me but miss the weighty bits, the complexity of having tiny little fellows inside of you. Believe me, those seedless guys are heartless. I was full and rounded, I was whole.

I began to shrink after a while – it didn't happen overnight. It was a slow process, the way a snail patiently approaches the end of its journey. At first I just noticed I was becoming slightly smaller. I could see the differences between myself and the new, fresher ones: I was getting softer. My skin turned a dirtier shade of green, and it became both more opaque and thinner, flimsier. I must admit, I was not the happiest of grapes at first.

People stopped picking me. At first they would have looked at me with greed, only discarding me because they had spotted another one just slightly older than myself, a little bit less fresh, a grape that needed to be eaten before things went south. At some point, however, *I* began to be considered as a grape that was losing its full potential. Yet I never got eaten. I just didn't, and they kept picking other grapes instead, bathing them in a bowl full of water before putting them in their mouths. I stayed in my plastic box; its walls tarnished and I couldn't see what else was going on in that fridge that was my home.

And then, one day, they took me out. They put me on a plate among others of my kind and they left us in the backyard, under the sun. It was hot, especially after spending those few days in the world inside a fridge. It was really, really hot. We tried to hide from the light, we tucked our bellies in to make ourselves smaller, to protect our skin from the heat. There was no use – we shrank, our skin wrinkling under the blazing sun. At night we would relax a little bit, straighten our bodies and lay down on the ceramic plate, which cooled down and felt very nice against the skin. But nights did not last; the sun came back soon enough, and we curled up even further, trying to escape.

Our skin has grown darker, too: we've turned brown, the color of chocolate. We've lost our juice, our plumpness, we've dried up. And yet I still love every single bit of my tiny body. It's all I got, and it's all I have to work with. Apparently I'm thought to be delicious, a tastier version of my older self, a stronger flavour: I represent the next level of sweetness.

I have lived a full life, I've been through each and every phase, and I can't imagine a better way of disappearing, of leaving this world, than being eaten now that I've reached the final stage. I can only hope that I'll be sweet and tasty, that I'll bring joy to salads, cakes and pastries, and that people will like me just the way I am, not wishing I were a grape but fully accepting – and appreciating – the raisin I've become.
