- I have started journaling my reading experiences. For fiction I am keeping my notes offline, as they are mostly my disorganized thoughts as I read a story, but for non-fiction I am taking notes in Notion, especially if I plan to go back to them later on.
- I'm a big procrastinator and very much empathize with Tim Urban's hilarious [TED talk on that topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU). Using *[pomodoros](https://www.google.com/search?q=pomodoro+technique&oq=pomodoro+te&aqs=chrome.0.0i131i433i457j0i131i433j69i57j0l5.2800j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)* helps me a lot with this problem, but I have yet to make myself use it systematically.

It's been a content-heavy week, so I have watched the following:

- *Inception*, Christopher Nolan. No, I'd never seen it before (I had however slept through it once or twice). Yes, I loved it.
- *The Gentlemen*
- *The hole*
- *Unorthodox* (TV show)
