title: "Sep 7th - Sep 13th"
---

- I don't have much to say about this week
- I'm continuing to work on Poplar's Virtual Try On unit
- I had my first COVID-19 test as I was getting ready for a (non-invasive, not serious) medical procedure. It's not something I look forward to doing ever again, although something tells me I will have to at some point. Most of us will.
- I watched *[Sunset Boulevard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Boulevard_(film))*, which is a 1950 movie by Billy Wilder. It's really good.
- I finished reading *[Radio Silence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25322449-radio-silence),* which was not my cup of tea, but it's not bad either. Many people do love it! I also finished *[Someone at a distance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/605668.Someone_at_a_Distance?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=btQJcoiRod&rank=1),* by the incredible Dorothy Whipple and I after I was done with it I hugged my copy very tight and felt sad and hopeful at the same time.
