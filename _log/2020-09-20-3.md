- This week I have been working on not eating in-between meals. This is not me going on a diet, this is me *not* eating every two hours and getting my body used to a reasonable level of hunger.
- I watched *[The Elephant Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_Man_(film))* by David Lynch, which was surprisingly beautiful and moving, and Christopher Nolan's *[Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film))*, which was was... ok.
- I finally finished the massive *[B is for Bauhaus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17470788-b-is-for-bauhaus?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Pry5vX5bmZ&rank=1)*, by Deyan Sudjic, which is a book about design, culture and – well – really a lot more. Some chapters were great, other's not so much. I still have it ⭐⭐⭐⭐
