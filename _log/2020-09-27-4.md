title: "Sep 21st - Sep 27th"
---

- This week I started reading *[Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=6QP0th2Scm&rank=1)* and putting some of the advice in there into practice.
- I've also been working on Poplar's new site navigation, taking into account both the pages we currently have as well as the ones that will come.
- This week I watched *[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard%27s_Eighth_Wife),* a 1938 romantic comedy by Ernst Lubitsch. It was quite good. I also watched [Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind) by Spielberg (1977). That was also quite good, but sadly not great in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend either of them.
- I also finished three books, none of which I will remember in a few months, but here we go: *[The Grace Year](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43263520-the-grace-year),* by Kim Liggett (Young Adult Fiction), [*The Photograph*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202858.The_Photograph?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=xJ3ukAaCEU&rank=3), by Penelope Lively (Fiction, 2004) and [*Pillow Thoughts*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32468495-pillow-thoughts?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=AZEhEJhB3s&rank=1) (Poetry)
- I also finished watching [Jane Goodall's Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/jane-goodall-teaches-conservation) on conservationism *The Story of Film* by Mark Cousins. Neither of them memorable.
