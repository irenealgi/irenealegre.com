title: "Sep 28th - Oct 4th"
---

- This week I have learned a lot about habit building
- I finished reading *Atomic Habits* yesterday and it's had a great impact on me as I have started implementing some charges in my life
- I have started doing some light exercising -just a few push ups, crunches, squats-every day, even if it's only 5 minutes
- I have started writing a bit of creative writing every morning and journaling for self-discovery
- I have started doing some yoga poses every morning before breakfast
- I have finished reading *[Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits)* and *[We have always lived in the castle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle),* and I enjoyed both of them very much ‚≠ê
- I have watched *[Insomnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia_(2002_film))* by Christopher Nolan.
