title: "Oct 5th - Oct 11th"
---

- I've been feeling quite organized this week!
- Started on the habit of exercising (even if very lightly) every day of the week. As a result, I feel better in my body and my core is getting stronger (although that might be more of a psychological thing than a reality)
- I looked into Information Architecture and read a whole book about the topic titled *[Everyday Information Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45153739-everyday-information-architecture)* by Lisa Maria Martin
- This week we have started watching [*Catch and Halt Fire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(TV_series)), which is an underrated show we'd never heard of before
- I fell asleep watching [*One flew over the cuckoo's
  nest*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo%27s_Nest_(film))
  (1975), so will have to watch that again when I'm feeling more... awake. We
  also watched the new adaptation of
  [*Emma*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_(2020_film)), Jane Austen's 1816
  novel about a young, rich and beautiful girl playing Cupido. I read the novel
  years ago and was familiar with the plot, but my partner got lost several
  times and eventually lost all interest in the story.
