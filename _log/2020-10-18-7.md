- This week I stumbled upon Yeonmi Park's [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/YeonmiParkOfficial) and I binged half of
  her channel, watched a few interviews with her and got her book from the
  library. I only knew the basics about the North Korean regime, but learning
  more about that has opened up my eyes to other things as well that go beyond
  the politics of one country and can apply to a myriad of things both personal
  and political.
- I have started playing the ukulele with regularity. At the moment I have to
  keep it to 10 mins a day because my finger tips really hurt - I have no
  previous experience with string instruments.
- I'm continuing to journal daily, and have found a list of [daily
  questions](https://www.takingcareofyou.co.uk/365-journal-prompts-for-self-discovery/)
  and daily [writing
  prompts](https://thinkwritten.com/365-creative-writing-prompts/) to get the
  ball rolling.
- We have started watching Ramon Gener's [This is
  Opera](https://thisisopera.store/) and we have also watched Orson Welles'
  [*The Lady from Shanghai
  (1947)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_from_Shanghai), which I
  didn't like, and Lulu Wang's comedy [*The
  Farewell*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farewell_(2019_film)) about a
  Chinese family dealing with the elderly grandmother's diagnosis of cancer,
  which I enjoyed very much.
- I finished reading *[The Vanishing
  Half](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=lQxTbdMv3I&rank=1)*
  by Brit Bennett, which tells the story of two fair-skinned black twins in the
  60s and how one of them abandons the other in order to live her life passing
  as a white woman. I found the premise of the book very interesting and would
  recommend it.
