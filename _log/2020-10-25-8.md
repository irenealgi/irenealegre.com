title: "Oct 19th - Oct 25th"
---

- This week has been a bit of a weird one mental health-wise, but I managed to stick to my ukulele practice and continue building those calluses!
- I've been thinking a bit more about the kind of content I consume online as well as in book format, and I'm making a conscious decision to be more mindful about that and choose more wisely.
- I've been playing [*Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Country:_Tropical_Freeze)
- This week I finished reading Yeonmi Park's *[In order to live](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611623-in-order-to-live?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=PMVJrPiEhX&rank=1)* and also *[Holes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38709.Holes?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=w4lTXN3dzU&rank=1)* by Louis Sachar, which I've been reading alongside my students (I'm teaching English to some family members!)
- We watched *[Whisper of the Heart (1995)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_of_the_Heart)*  by Yoshifumi Kond≈ç, a Japanese animated film about a teenage girl trying to figure out what she wants to do (professionally) in the future and falling in love with a teenage boy on the same journey. We also watched a documentary on silent film director Buster Keaton titled [*The Great Buster*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8758548/). Buster Keaton may be one of the few silent film directors I actually don't find boring (that *may* change as I grow more used to watching classic and silent movies, but it also *may not*).
