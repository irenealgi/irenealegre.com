- My mental health is still playing havoc with my life, so it's a bit harder to focus on productivity and learning. Next week I'm on holiday (*at home* holidays) so I'll hopefully be reading a lot more, especially since we're going back into lockdown mid-week.
- I'm still playing the ukulele on the daily, and doing it for longer stretches of time now that my finger tips don't hurt as much. I'm learning new strumming patterns, too! Still struggling to sing along to my strumming though.
- This weekend we have watched *[Slumdog Millionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire)* which I'd never seen before, and it was really good! Really enjoyed that one. We also watched Kubrick's *[Full Metal Jacket (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket)* which was not my cup of tea, yet interesting all the same.
- I finished reading *[Content Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36124105-content-design)* by Sarah Richards, which was ok but could have been better (I also spotted a few typos and grammatical mistakes that really bothered me given the subject of the book), and I also finished *[To the lighthouse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59716.To_the_Lighthouse?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=00gVlAnv5i&rank=1)* by Virginia Woolf. It has taken me two months to finish this relatively short book, and it has been a struggle I sadly do not wish upon anyone else. I've read a few Virginia Woolf's books throughout the years and they'd been enjoyable on the whole, but this was a no-go for me.
