title: "Nov 2nd - Nov 8th"
---
- This week has been really good, especially since we were on a staycation. We didn't do much, but we slept a lot, read a lot and watched many movies.
- I'm still playing the ukulele, and have been learning to play Camila Cabello's *Havana*, but the strumming is really hard to get right, at least for a newbie like me!
- Among the movies we have watched, it's worth highlighting [*The Endless Trench*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Endless_Trench) by Jon Garaño, Aitor Arregi and Jose Mari Goenaga, a film about a man who hides in his own house for 30 years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, and [*Amadeus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)) by Miloš Forman, a brilliant study on envy loosely based on the friendship between Mozart and Salieri.
- In terms of reading, I have finished *[Persuasion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion)* by Jane Austen and also written [a blog post about why everyone should read (at least) one novel](http://irenealegre.com/jane-austen) by her.
