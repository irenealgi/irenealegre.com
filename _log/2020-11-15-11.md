title: "Nov 9th - Nov 15th"

- This week has also been quite good; I have started a new project at work I'm really excited about!
- I have learned a new song on the ukulele, Taylor Swift's *[Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnNIb54ggGA) .* I had to learn the song by heart first so that I could then sing along while playing. Some of the transitions are still tricky to do quickly enough, but I'm getting there!
- Yesterday we watched *[It happened one night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Happened_One_Night)* by Frank Capra, a 1934 film about a millionaire's daughter who decides to escape and the journalist she meets along the way. It's a screwball comedy.
- I have finished reading [*I've been meaning to tell you*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37487246-i-ve-been-meaning-to-tell-you), David Chariandy's letter to his thirteen-year-old daughter. He mostly discusses his experiences with racism as a black man in modern Canada.
- I'm also reading Nassim Taleb's *[Antifragile](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile)*. It's going to take me a long while to finish it, but so far I'm really enjoying it and it's making me re-consider a lot of my ideas and views.
- Two interesting articles I've come across this week are [*The spiral of silence*](https://fs.blog/2020/09/spiral-of-silence/) and [*Make Design System right*](https://blog.plantapp.io/post/make-design-system-right).
- As a bonus, there's this article by Tim Urban (Wait but why) on [family trees and ancestry](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/your-family-past-present-and-future.html). I don't know how to describe this, but it's interesting, funny and humbling.
