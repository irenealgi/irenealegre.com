- I don't have much to update on this week; I feel like I haven't done much that's interesting
- I *have* discovered a wonderful singer called [Laufey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpKl3waLmccNeYH9LGYjUQ/videos) and she's just brilliant
- Barre chords on the ukulele are getting slightly easier, but still struggling with barre chords on the first fret. My index finger and thumb start cramping pretty quickly, and so does my forearm. It's a sign I'm not strong enough!
- I'm still reading the same really long books:
  - [*Antifragile,*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile) Nassim Taleb
  - [*The righteous mind*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind), Jonathan Haidt
  - [*I capture the castle*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31122.I_Capture_the_Castle), Dodie Smith
- We have watched a Spanish TV series that was phenomenal; it's about a group of [riot policemen](https://variety.com/2019/tv/global/rodrigo-sorogoyen-antidisturbios-riot-police-human-drama-1203450833/) and the aftermath of an eviction gone awry. It feels more like a documentary than fiction, especially in its first episode, and all the actors do an incredible job. Highly recommend!
- We have also watched Hitchcock [Dial M for Murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial_M_for_Murder), which was also really good
