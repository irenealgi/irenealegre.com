- This week hasn't felt that productive in terms of things outside work. I have been focusing a lot on design work for Poplar Studio, which has left deflated after 7pm and with no much time for reading. I have also felt more tired than usual and more lethargic, which might be a seasonal thing for me (as it is for many others), so I sleep longer hours and haven't been reading in the mornings.
- Ukulele-wise, I have been playing [A million dreams](https://ukutabs.com/m/misc-movies/a-million-dreams/), which is a beautiful song I adore.
- We watched Billy Wilder's [*Double indemnity*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Indemnity) which in my view was not as amazing as I thought it'd be, and we also watched Spanish director Javier Fesser's *Historias Lamentables,* which was very funny.

And, finally, you wouldn't believe it: I'm still reading the same really long books!
