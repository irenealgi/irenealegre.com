title: "Dec 7th - Dec 13th"
---
- We arrived in Madrid on Thursday 10th – we're working from home from my partner's childhood home!
- I sadly had to leave my ukulele behind, but luckily on of my sisters-in-law lend me her guitar. I'd never played a guitar before, so I'm unsurprisingly terrible at it. At the moment I'm just working on transitioning between four chords fast enough that it sounds like a song.
- We celebrated a few birthdays on Saturday and several people in the family came over for lunch and board games – it was super fun!
- Travelling in the times of Coronavirus is a little bit odd – we took an evening flight and there were only two other flights scheduled that night, which is so strange!

Still reading (and very much enjoying):
