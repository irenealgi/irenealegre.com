- I've been practicing with the guitar and can now kind-of-sort-of play *Moon River*, which sounds beautiful! Now I want a guitar.
- I've been on holiday since Friday 18th, and I've welcomed the break.
- I've binged on the new seasons of *This is us* and *Grey's Anatomy* (I know, still); both shows have introduced the pandemic into their plot lines, *Grey's Anatomy* in particular are focusing a lot on the impact of COVID-19 on hospitals, medical practitioners, etc.
- Reading-wise, I have (finally!) finished *I capture the castle* by Dodie Smith. It's an interesting take on the role of women in England in the 1930s and how marrwas still - even then - a perfectly fine option to guarantee your own survival and that of your family.
- Still reading [*Antifragile*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile) and [*The righteous mind*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind). In terms of fiction, I have started [*Red at the bone*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43697186-red-at-the-bone), by Jacqueline Woodson.
