- Back in London, my mood has continued to be low, partly because it's been raining most of the week and I haven't been able to go outside anyway because I'm self-isolating.
- I'm almost done reading [_The righteous mind_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind), and I'm halfway through [_The mermaids singing_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/459386.The_Mermaids_Singing). I've put together a list of books I would like to read in 2021. It's not meant as a constraint, but rather as an orientation.
- We have started watching [_Money heist_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Heist). I know, I know, we're quite late to that party. We just finished Season 1 and so far it's quite good with a few misses here and there. I have also started watching Season 3 of [_Killing Eve_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve), which - in all honesty - is getting a bit too crazy even for its own standards.
- We finally watched [_Tenet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_(film)), and - while I love some of Nolan's movies - this is not one of his best in my opinion. Too weird for my liking.
- I've learned a couple of things on the ukulele, but what I'm really looking forward to is the new keyboard I ordered just yesterday. It should arrive sometime this week!
- I mentioned I started cutting down on unhealthy food, and so far it's going quite well. What I try to do is roast a bunch of vegetables which I can then mix with pasta, rice and protein sources.
