title: "Jan 18th - Jan 24th"
---

This week has been my birthday week (Jan 21st), and both me and my partner took Thursday and Friday off to celebrate and relax. We haven't done anything special because â€“ well, COVID-19 - but my parents bought me a keyboard as a present and we have both been playing a lot and learning. All I've known about piano until this point was to play by ear and with just my right hand. I'm lucky that I can do melody quite faithfully almost without trying, as if I were just sensing where the next sound falls. Adding left hand moves, however, is a different story. I'm not particularly good at coordination, and so learning to move both hands at the same time effectively will take time and practice. Keeping the rythm is also not my forte, or at least it doesn't come as easy to me as melody does. So here is what I _have_ learned so far.
- I can now play all the major chords in the key of C, and invert as and when I need to to facilitate shifting between chords
- I have a somewhat decent understanding of how to harmonise chords and notes within the key of C. I try to stick to C for now, as I'm not familiar with all the chords in other keys (even though I can easily play the melody in its original key)
- I have learned to shift from single notes to chords, and to play chords with my right hand while I do bits of melody on the left. This has to be one of the things that have surprised me the most.
- I have gone through the entire Piano for Dummies, which gives you a basic walkthrough of music theory and how to read music. I'll be honest, my weakest point is being able to read and replicate beats as they have been written. It helps to know the song in advance.
- I can read music, but I'm awfully slow at it. For now I have to write the notes on the staff (and the chords where applicable). I know this is cheating, but I _am_ getting faster at doing this. Also, throwing the Bass Clef into the mix has been challenging,
- Some songs I have started to learn how to play are two very basic versions of _Jurassic Park_ and Adele's _Hello_.

I may have spent between 10-15 hours reading up and playing over the last few days.

Other things that have happened this week:

- I finished [_The righteous mind_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind) by Johnathan Haidt, which I strongly reccommend.
- I have put together a Notion page where I have listed all the books I want to read this year. I have a list of 52 books and, being realistic, I don't expect I'll be able to read more than 20 books this year. This is because many of them are very long, and I also want to spend quite a lot of time on the piano this year.
- I decided to abandon [_The mermaids singing_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/459386.The_Mermaids_Singing) by Val McDermid because I was not enjoying it, I wasn't learning from it and it was making me uncomfortable at times.
- We have been watching [_Money heist_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Heist), and finished the second part last night. I look forward to starting the new season tonight!
- I have started reading [_I contain multitudes_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213168-i-contain-multitudes) by Ed Yong and [_The Eighth Life_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41071389-the-eighth-life) by Nino Haratischwili. Both of these are _very_ long, so I don't expect to finish either of them until end of February. We'll see.
