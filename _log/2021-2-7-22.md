- This week has been better than previous ones, mostly because I have been going outside every morning, except for one day where I couldn't go out so I did 30 minutes of yoga instead. It's definitely improved my mood and how I feel about my body and my health. This next week I want to continue going out every morning and visiting the park; I think it might be a viable solution to the winter/pandemic blues.

- I'm still practicing piano about one hour a day, sometimes more. Sometimes it can get frustrating, especially if the piece is a tad difficult for my current level, but it's very rewarding when I finally manage to play it right. Yesterday I was able to play the first bits of Debussy's Clair de Lune ([a very easy version](https://musescore.com/user/31902283/scores/5933450)).

- We have finished watching [_Money heist_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Heist) - it's a very uneven show with some moments of brilliance and many other scenes that feel both unrealistic and anticlimatic.
- I'm still reading [_I contain multitudes_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213168-i-contain-multitudes) by Ed Yong and [_The Eighth Life_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41071389-the-eighth-life) by Nino Haratischwili. Both of these are _very_ long, so I don't expect to finish either of them until end of February. We'll see.
