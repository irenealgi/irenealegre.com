title: "January 2022"
---

- I haven't updated in a very long time, but my husband keeps insisting that I do, so here we go!
- I'm 26 weeks pregnant as of today (Jan 13 2022) with our first girl, which we'll be calling Olivia.
- We also got married in December 2021 in a very small (like, 12 people small) wedding ceremony which we loved.
- My first trimester of pregnancy was rough, which made it a lot harder to get anything done, including my reading goals.
- Here's a list of the books I would like to read this year, and why:
1. *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall*, Anne Br√∂nte
I've already read Anne's two older and more famous sisters, Charlotte and Emily, but I've heard some really exciting things about this novel and I look forward to reading it this year!
2. *Klara and the Sun*, Kazuo Ishiguro
I don't love everything that Ishiguro writes, but I have loved a couple of his novels very much, especially *Never let me go*. In this book he goes back to sci-fi and features an Artificial Intelligence as a narrator, which could be fascinating.
3. *Great expectations* or *A tale of two cities*, Charles Dickens
I can't believe I've got to this point, but I'm almost 34 years ago, hold an English Degree and have never read a Dickens novel. Not one. I did try many years ago, so he might just not be the right author for me, but maybe I'm a big enough girl now and can finally finish one of his books. We'll see.
4. *Forbidden Colors*, Yukio Mishima
I purchased this in a Spanish translation many years ago and it's remained unread. I will try to take it to the UK with me this time around and see if I finally get around to reading it.
5. *Notre-Dame de Paris*, Victor Hugo
Listen, I'm making no promises other than *I will try to read this*. I will. And that will be enough.
6. *The grapes of wrath*, John Steinbeck
I read *East of Eden* back in 2020 and was astonished by how good it actually was, so I look forward to reading this one this year.
7. *The razor's edge*, William Somerset Maugham
I read another book by Somerset Maugham a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so I'm keen to read this one this year.
8. *Wives and Daughters*, Elizabeth Gaskell
Gaskell is another XIX century British author that I haven't got around to reading yet!
9. *Gone with the wind*, Margaret Mitchell
Apparently a very readable and absorbing modern classic. Can't wait!
10. *Anne of Green Gables #2*, Lucy Maud Montgomery
The second instalment of Anne's adventures in Avonlea! I read the first book in 2021 in the midsts of my first trimester of pregnancy and it was such a soothing book!
11. *The count of Monte Cristo*, Alexandre Dumas
Another highly readable classic that I truly look forward to!
12. *Les Liaisons dangereuses*, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos
Such an early and cheeky book to read ;)
13. *The World According to Garp*, John Irving
I haven't read an Irving novel *in years*, and yet I recall really enjoying his writing back when I was reading novels by him. I don't know what happened there - could this be the year I finally read *The world according to Garp*?
14. *Greenbanks*, Dorothy Whipple
What can I say, I read one Whipple a year. She's one of my favourite authors by far. I tried to read this one in 2021 but wasn't feeling well enough to hold the heavy book in my hands :(
