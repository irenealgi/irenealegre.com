‘The tomato is one of my favourite fruits’, I told my partner once, casually, as
if I was telling him that my favourite shade of blue was turquoise, or that I
was thinking of wearing a cocktail dress to my cousin’s wedding the week after.
I smiled to myself. I knew what was about to unravel.

I observed his face as he pondered for a couple of seconds. He likes a good
heated discussion even more than I do.

‘But a tomato is not a fruit’, he said.

Oh, but it is.

> The [confusion](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/confusion){:target="_blank"} about
> ‘fruit’ and ‘vegetable’ arises because of the differences in usage between
scientists and cooks. Scientifically speaking, a tomato is definitely a fruit.
True fruits are developed from the
[ovary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ovary){:target="_blank"} in the base of the
flower, and contain the
[seeds](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/seed){:target="_blank"} of the plant (though
[cultivated](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cultivate){:target="_blank"} forms may
be seedless). Blueberries, raspberries, and oranges are true fruits, and so are
many kinds of nut. Some plants have a soft part which supports the seeds and is
also called a ‘fruit’, though it is not developed from the ovary: the strawberry
is an example. — [Oxford
Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/is-a-tomato-a-fruit-or-a-vegetable){:target="_blank"}

## This is truly a case of t*uh*-mey-toh vs t*uh*-mah-toh, after all

It was decided back in freaking 1893 that tomatoes by the Supreme Court of the
United States that, under U.S. customs regulations, **the tomato should be
classified as a vegetable rather than a fruit.**

I don’t know about you, but I find
[this](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/149/304/case.html){:target="_blank"}
fascinating.

> One of the witnesses answered as follows:

> “Well, it does not classify all things there, but they are correct as far as
> they go. It does not take all kinds of fruit or vegetables; it takes a portion
of them. I think the words ‘fruit’ and ‘vegetable’ have the same meaning in
trade today that they had on March 1, 1883. I understand that the term ‘fruit’
is applied in trade only to such plants or parts of plants as contain the seeds.
There are more vegetables than those in the enumeration given in Webster’s
Dictionary under the term ‘vegetable,’ as ‘cabbage, cauliflower, turnips,
potatoes, peas, beans, and the like,’ probably covered by the words ‘and the
like.’”

> The other witness testified:

> “I don’t think the term ‘fruit’ or the term ‘vegetables’ had, in March, 1883,
> and prior thereto, any special meaning in trade and commerce in this country
different from that which I have read here from the dictionaries.”

**And that’s how supermarkets categorise tomatoes today, because otherwise
consumers would never be able to find them on their websites.** Except that’s
not always the case.

## Doing my grocery shopping

Here’s Morrisons, following *the law*. Morrisons makes tomatoes very easy to
find, categorising them as vegetables.

Tesco play it cool by giving lettuce, tomatoes and — strangely enough– dips, a
category of their own: *Fresh Salad & Dips*.

But my favourite are Sainsbury’s. So Sainsbury’s seem to go follow the rule just
like their old friend Morrisons.

But then they I searched for tomatoes using the search bar and this just blew my
mind. *Christmas > The Big Day > Christmas Brunch > Full cooked breakfast. *I
mean, what? As a user, I don’t understand why they just made tomatoes a seasonal
thing. This confuses me.

## Mapping out the world

I’m a big fan of Linguistics — I mean, I kind of have a degree in English, after
all, and Linguistics made up a big chunk of my degree. I like how language maps
out the world, and how — by the mere process of *naming — *it puts things into
categories.

Tomatoes might be a fruit, but as long as people use and see them as a
vegetable, they will remain so in the mind of most of us. We will look for them
next to the lettuce, not side by side with the strawberries. And I like how
Information Architects make a point of understanding how people perceive and
describe the world and translating their view into their designs.

## Sometimes it’s difficult. Or very difficult.

Let’s look at Clarks’ shoe collection for women. Before anything else, they
distinguish between *Shoes *and *Boots*, as if not boots were not a type of
shoe. Then you can select Black Shoes, where I’m assuming you’ll find
high-heeled shoes, brogues, trainers or pumps, all of them — of course– black.

![](images/blog/tomatoes/clarks.png)

You can also select *Heels*, which is a slightly misleading term because *all
shoes have heels*, but the user is most likely assuming they mean *high *heels.
But then you can also select *Party Styles*, which will probably include high
heels and pumps, but not trainers.

Even though they make a clear distinction between *Shoes *and *Boots*, once you
select *Wedges* within the *Shoes* category, this is the first thing you see.

![](images/blog/tomatoes/clarks_two.png)

Yes, these are boots. *Wedge boots*, to be more exact.

ASOS try to make sense of their own shoe department below.

Some of their boots are high-heeled, and some of them might be absolutely
perfect for the winter months. Party Shoes might be flat and comfy, smart and
covered or open-toed and with 4-inch heels. Who knows?

Let’s also appreciate the fact that Socks & Tights can be found within the Shoes
category. I would have thought they should be in *Accessories *or *Underwear*,
but then again — I haven’t done any user testing.

## This is just the beginning

This article is by no means a critique of how some very popular e-commerce sites
have categorised their products, but rather an in-depth appreciation of the
complexity of these sites.

As a Junior UX Designer, I find Information Architecture and Taxonomy engrossing
because they tap into how the user understands the world, the industry and
–ultimately– your product. I will continue to do some research on this and will
probably write a more advanced post on Information Architecture early next year.
