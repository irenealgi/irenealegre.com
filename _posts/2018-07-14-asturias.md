In August 2017 we went to Asturias in northern Spain. I'd never been in that area of my country before, and I _loved_ being the peace of being surrounded by nature and not having that many people around. The food was also quite splendid, as is typical in the whole country and particularly up north.

We stayed in a small hotel by the coast, which meant we had easy and quick access to numerous beaches. The water is cold and the weather quite unpredictable, which meant there were never that many tourists around.

We also visited several towns in the area, including Oviedo and GijÃ³n, the largest cities in the region.

The beach of Torimbia is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been in. It was almost empty except for a few fellow bathers. The beach is inside a bay, and the hills that surround it are the perfect hub for caravans and beautiful sunsets. Here is where we met this ridiculously gorgeous family.

We also decided to spend a day canoeing down down the Sella river.

On one of our last days there, we went on a short trekking path that led us to a secluded little lake. The water was freezing, but Arturo ventured in!
