I was in the park the other day and, suddenly, I noticed how beautiful the flowers were. I mean, it's not like I'd never noticed the beauty of flowers before, but this time around I also realised that there are no flowers in ugly colours. Really. Even [in flowers that are considered ugly](https://www.google.com/search?q=ugly+flower&sxsrf=ALeKk023HXCJ7sWvJNV145frJzTlxeZyxg:1592162707329&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjQ9eCkhILqAhVSSxUIHT7vCu8Q_AUoAXoECBMQAw&biw=1440&bih=766), the colours are themselves beautiful.

### What constitutes an ugly colour, though?

Well, you may be thinking that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that whether a colour is ugly or not is entirely subjective. And I agree. But I also don't. Just like humans show a preference for symmetry or clear lines, I would argue that we also have a strong preference for clean colours.   

So, what makes a colour clean? I would start by defining what makes a colour *not clean*. A colour that is not clean - or a colour that is *dirty* or *muddy* - is one that is desaturated, often because it's got some grey undertones in it.

While we can find desaturated colours in nature - tree trunks are a good example -, when it comes to flowers they tend to have brighter colours. Even in pastels, where there is a fair amount of white, the petals remain bright and vivid. This is so that they attract other animal species such as bees.

### How does that impact my design?

I tend to gravitate towards *pure* or *clean* colours anyway because it's a personal preference of mine, and I do dislike desaturated colours in fabrics, furniture and even vegetables and fruit, but I do know people who have a different preference. Regardless of personal taste, however, I'm proposing that designs might benefit from cleaner palettes that are naturally - hehe - pleasant to the eye. Why not take inspiration from nature the next time you're defining your colour palette?
