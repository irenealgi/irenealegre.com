    <p>I’m a learner. Challenges help me thrive.</p>

    <p>After spending two years doing B2B Marketing for a SaaS startup, I made
    the decision to focus on how users experience a product rather than
    whether they will eventually buy it – or not. UX design is about
    understanding user and business needs in equal measure, and finding a
    middleground between the two.</p>

    <p>I enjoy solving problems and coming up with universal solutions that will
    stand the test of time and will make sense to as many users as possible.</p>

    <p>I thrive in environments that evolve and adapt quickly, and I’m not
    afraid to learn new things, start using new tools and take on board new
    projects – if anything, that makes me the happiest employee on Earth.</p>
