I’m a learner. Challenges help me thrive.


UX design is about understanding user and business needs in equal measure, and finding a middleground between the two. A happy business usually requires happy users, but happy users don’t always make a business happy.

I enjoy solving problems and coming up with universal solutions that will stand the test of time and will make sense to as many users as possible.

I thrive in environments that evolve and adapt quickly, and I’m not afraid to learn new things, start using new tools and take on board new projects – if anything, that makes me the happiest employee on Earth.
