      I’m a learner. Challenges help me thrive.

      UX design is about understanding user and business needs in equal measure,
      and finding a middleground between the two.

      I enjoy solving problems and coming up with universal solutions that will stand
      the test of time and will make sense to as many users as possible.

      I thrive in environments that evolve and adapt quickly, and I’m
      not afraid to learn new things, start using new tools and take on board
      new projects – if anything, that makes me the happiest employee on Earth.
