I’m a learner. Challenges help me thrive.

After spending two years doing B2B Marketing at [Onfido](https://onfido.com/){:target="_blank"}, I made the decision to focus on how users experience a product rather than whether they will eventually buy it – or not. UX design is about understanding user and business needs in equal measure, and finding a middle-ground between the two.

I enjoy solving problems and coming up with universal solutions that will stand the test of time and will make sense to as many users as possible.

I thrive in environments that evolve and adapt quickly, and I’m not afraid to learn new things, start using new tools and take on board new projects – if anything, that makes me the happiest employee on Earth.

When I’m not designing, I love to [read](reading-list) and [write](blog), talk (a lot) or take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/25124902@N04/sets/72157671009291723){:target="_blank"}. Riding my red bike in the summer fills me with joy, planning the year, month or week on my bullet journal makes me feel awesome and I recently started learning to play the ukulele – because I like to sing, even if just to myself.

You will find a comprehensive list of all my UX skills and work experience [in my CV](irene-alegre-cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
