I’m a learner. Challenges help me thrive. 

After spending two years doing B2B Marketing at Onfido, I made the decision to focus on how users experience a product rather than whether they will eventually buy it – or not. UX design is about understanding user and business needs in equal measure, and finding a middleground between the two. 

I enjoy solving problems and coming up with universal solutions that will stand the test of time and will make sense to as many users as possible. 

I thrive in environments that evolve and adapt quickly, and I’m not afraid to learn new things, start using new tools and take on board new projects – if anything, that makes me the happiest employee on Earth.

When I’m not designing, I love to read, talk (a lot) or watch a movie with my partner, who is a cinephile. Riding my red bike in the summer fills me with joy, planning the year, month or week on my bullet journal makes me feel awesome and I recently started learning to play the ukelele – because I like to sing, even if just to myself.
