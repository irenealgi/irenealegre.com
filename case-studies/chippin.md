## The Brief

[Chippin](https://chippin.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} enables online merchants to allow their
customers to easily and securely share the cost of an online purchase.
Therefore, **Chippin functions as a payment gateway and increases the chances of
users finishing their payment transactions.**

### The objective

To review the user journey from landing to payments and make this as simple and
intuitive as possible while ensuring there is enough information for the user to
complete the transaction.

## Research

### The competition

Glide, Splitit and Make It Social are among our competitors. Looking at their business propositions, the following stood out:

* Chippin’s proposition is unique in the marketplace
* Competitor business models include fundraising, payment gateways and bill
splitting
* Most competitors need customer login


### User reviews

> “Great concept. I hate chasing people for money!”   
> “Quick Stripe payment is great”  
> “I like that it has just a few steps”

## Assessing the current platform: User experiences and feedback

Once we started testing the current flow with real users (see below), we quickly
realised it was an emotional rollercoaster; there were a lot of ups and downs,
and adding contributors was frustrating. Users also had issues with the site’s
level of trustworthiness, were not aware of the brand and were unsure as to how
secure the process was. We have also listed some of the feedback we received on several of the current
site’s features.

After a few user interviews and testings it became clear to us that there four
main themes we would be focusing on during the following two weeks:

* Education
* Visuals
* Layout
* Security

## Meet Christina

## The scenario

Christina’s best friend Michelle is moving to Australia and she is buying her a
beautiful handbag from Fairfax & Favor as a farewell present with three other
friends: Maya, Jane and Tony.

**At the merchant checkout, she notices the Chippin option for splitting the
transaction cost online and clicks on this.**

## Design Studio Outcomes

We ran a design studio with the Chippin founders to gather up ideas for our
screen designs. Our design studio focused on education, trying to come up with
different methods to inform and reassure the user, which we then incorporated in
our user flows.

## The Welcome Screen

**The Welcome Screen was probably the most complex one of the bunch,** as we had to
get the educational and trust pieces right without overwhelming the user or
cramming it up with information. **The page had to also include information on the
product that’s going to be purchased and create continuity** from the previous
screen, which is the merchant’s checkout screen.

## Adding the contributors

The problem with the contributors page was that **there was too much going on** and too many decisions to be made (for the user, as well as for us). We ended up simplifying it and making
it as straightforward as possible.

## Next Steps

* The current solution doesn't solve the potential issues caused by adding new contributors to the dashboard.

* The need for someone's email might add an extra layer of friction. An integration with Facebook would help users interact through an alternative channel.

* The underwriting tick box could actually be mistaken for a T&Cs check box, which could cause users to agree without understanding this feature.

* The new flow does not include any feedback for when things go wrong (e.g. when users don't lock the amounts).
