[Healum](http://www.healum.com/){:target="_blank"} is a new healthtech startup with a clear mission: to enable health professionals to improve health outcomes for 100 million people.

## The Brief: Building an ecosystem for GPs and patients

As part of their interview process, Healum challenged me to design an ecosystem for GPs and patients consisting of two parts:

#### A desktop web application that enables GPs and other medical professionals to build healthcare plans for their patients

These are some of the requirements for the platform:

* A wellbeing and healthcare plan is a collection of food, exercise, local services, medicines, goals, challenges, habits that are personalized for a particular patient depending on their personal motivations, medical conditions, age, gender and personal preferences
* A database of recipes, exercises, local services, medicines, informational content (articles), goals, challenges and habits will be available to the health care professional to choose and pick from.
* A healthcare plan should incorporate insights provided through patient usage analytics and other passive patient behavioral data available at the time of creation of a healthcare plan, allowing the user to make better informed choices when creating a healthcare and wellbeing plan for a patient or a condition

#### A mobile app that enables patients to review their healthcare plan, discover ways in which to lead a healthier lifestyle and track their progress

These are some of the requirements for the app:

* Allow the user to view the plan (either time bound or open ended) that has been created by their clinic / GP / nurse in the app
* Allow the user to create their own health and wellbeing care plan and share it with their healthcare professional (to get any input)
* The patient should be able to swap plan options they don’t like – to have extended choice
* The patient should be able to ‘complete’ things from the plan to inform the healthcare professional of their progress

## User stories

GP Rosie and Patient Suzanne meet at the clinic for the regular check-up, and after discussing Suzanne's high BMI and lack of fitness, the decide to use the Healum ecosystem to get Suzanne to a lower BMI and a healthier body on the overall.

Suzanne is particularly motivated to change, as she's struggling to keep up with her fiance's fitness levels, and last time they went trekking she had to quit the trip mid-way and get a bus. She also loves dancing, and would like to dance at her wedding without getting tired – she's getting married in six months! The plan is to get her down to 65-70 kg by the end of the year.

They will also be working on Suzanne's mental health, as she's been quite stressed out lately and in need of some quiet time. She holds a high demanding job in a corporate environment, and it's getting the best of her! In order to get her to have some down time, a plan has been put into place so that Suzanne is reminded to breath, meditate and read romantic novels (which she loves doing).

## User flows

After a lot of [thinking, creating user personas, storyboarding, sketching and just – well – doodling](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i1agdQ3ebcL3ua5rXugp5XGRDEZQ1g7c){:target="_blank"}, I came up with the following user flows for the desktop web app (Rosie the GP) and the mobile app (Suzanne the patient).

Basically, Rosie is in charge of creating the plan while Suzanne can *only* review the plan, follow the instructions and check-in every time she completes a meal or exercise.



## Final mockups

Here's the truth about the final mockups and visuals: they differ massively from the original wireframes. This is probably due to time constraints, as not enough time was spent on the first phase of wireframing, where I mostly just created a screen flow and got a rough idea of what elements would be in each screen.

When the time came to work on the visuals, I realised there were a lot of things that didn't make much sense in the original wireframes (some time and perspective also helped me with that, as well as some user testing on the first iterations on the visuals).

### Desktop

#### Food recipe (database) filter
This one is quite faithful to its [original wireframe](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19HwhkVuw7hhX5L2eWA5Zl6nb5hZBsvq7){:target="_blank"}. This screen is inspired by [LEON's menu](https://leon.co/menu/all-day/){:target="_blank"}, which proposes a set of filters that reduce your list of items until you are left with the ones most suitable for you (or your patient). I changed the filters to fit the requirements of a doctor looking to improve their patient's health and body weight.

#### Patient profile
There is no wireframe for this screen, as while working on the final prototype I realised this page was very much needed. This screen functions as a "Patient Profile", where the doctor can see any previous reports (not in the example), medication the patient is on and latest test results, as well as the healthcare plan the patient is on (which is also created through this page).

#### Health plan screen
This screen deviates slightly from its [original version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1db1HP7O4L_l6Eq3qkRzEsQ8Np0YslShr){:target="_blank"}, but not that much. In here, Rosie can find all of Suzanne's goals for the next week (or whatever period of time), as well as see how many of these have been accomplished already (and how many times). It mirrors the mobile app's welcome screen.

### Mobile app

#### Welcome screen, filter and Food recipes screen

#### Food recipes screen, Check-in screen and Food recipe screen

## Conclusions

* This has been an interesting challenge, as it's always cool to work on two sides of an application
* I feel like more time would be required to work out the screens that are needed for each user to achieve their goals. I think having a chat with a medical professional would inform many of the mental questions I had while working on this (some of them you'll find scribbled among many other doodles)
* While I'm quite happy with the visuals, having something more striking and/or fun could contribute to higher engagement on the patient's side
