I love learning and taking on new challenges. I don’t just say that; it’s the
truth. Just check out my work experience – I’ve been acquiring new skills since
2007, and I don’t plan on stopping any time soon.


RELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE: KEEPING IT SHORT AND SWEET

June 2015 – August 2017: Marketing at fast-growing startup Onfido

Onfido as a content creator when the team consisted of only three people, but
slowly evolved into more of a Digital Marketing role where I looked after
online campaigns, landing page creation and metrics. As it was a startup, I
also supported with event organisation, sent newsletters, managed social media,
and many other bits and bobs.

April 2015 – June 2015: Marketing Paid Intern at Rowman & Littlelfield
International

This was a short work experience that allowed me – together with my experience
at HopeRoad (see below) – to eventually apply for a marketing role. While at
Rowman, I supported both Marketing & Sales teams with the creation of publicity
materials, internal presentations and marketing databases.

August 2014 – June 2015: Editorial & Marketing Assistant at HopeRoad Publishing

I worked with HopeRoad on a freelance basis for almost a year, and I supported
their very small team with editorial and marketing tasks. I looked after
marketing distribution (e.g. getting in touch with bloggers) and editorial
(reviewing and editing manuscripts with the author).

February 2012 – April 2013: Junior Editor at Loft Publications

Only mentioning this because that’s when I was first introduced to the world of
product design – among many other books, I wrote and put together [_Star
Product Designers_](https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780062210265/star-product-designers),
published by Harper Collins.
