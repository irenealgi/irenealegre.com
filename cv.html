<p>I love learning and taking on new challenges. I don’t just say that; it’s the truth. Just check out my work experience – I’ve been acquiring new skills since 2007, and I don’t plan on stopping any time soon.</p>
</br>

<p class="custom-pink cv_bold" style="font-size: 20px">RELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE: KEEPING IT SHORT AND SWEET</p>

<p class="cv_bold">June 2015 – August 2017: Marketing at fast-growing startup Onfido</p>
<p>Onfido as a content creator when the team consisted of only three people, but slowly evolved into more of a Digital Marketing role where I looked after online campaigns, landing page creation and metrics. As it was a startup, I also supported with event organisation, sent newsletters, managed social media, and many other bits and bobs.
</p>
<p class="cv_bold">April 2015 – June 2015: Marketing Paid Intern at Rowman & Littlelfield International</p>
<p>This was a short work experience that allowed me – together with my experience at HopeRoad (see below) – to eventually apply for a marketing role. While at Rowman, I supported both Marketing & Sales teams with the creation of publicity materials, internal presentations and marketing databases.
</p>
<p class="cv_bold">August 2014 – June 2015: Editorial & Marketing Assistant at HopeRoad Publishing</p>
<p>I worked with HopeRoad on a freelance basis for almost a year, and I supported their very small team with editorial and marketing tasks. I looked after marketing distribution (e.g. getting in touch with bloggers) and editorial (reviewing and editing manuscripts with the author).
</p>
<p class="cv_bold">February 2012 – April 2013: Junior Editor at Loft Publications</p>
<p>Only mentioning this because that’s when I was first introduced to the world of product design – among many other books, I wrote and put together <a href="https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780062210265/star-product-designers"><i>Star Product Designers</i></a>, published by Harper Collins.
