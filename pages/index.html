      <p class="home_project_text">Unmortgage is an alternative to renting that enables customers to gradually purchase the home they live in. Home buyers contribute with a 5% deposit while an institutional investor covers the cost of the rest of the
        property so that the customer can buy it from them little by little.</p>

      <p class="home_project_text">Chippin is a payments platform that allows
        users to split the cost of a product. Our two-weeks sprint included the
        re-design of the landing page, where most users felt confused and dropped
        off.</p>

      <p class="home_project_text">I have enjoyed the process of putting
        together my own website, and it has taught me a lot about design, as well
        as user experience. Because, ultimately, my website is not really meant
        to be seen by me.</p>
